# Data Visualization

## Assignment 2: Good and Bad Data Visualization

### Requirements:

- Data visualizations are important tools for communication and convincing; we need to be able to evaluate the ways that data are presented in visual form to be critical consumers of information 
- To test your evaluation skills, locate two public data visualizations online, one good and one bad  
    - You can find data visualizations at https://public.tableau.com/app/discover or https://datavizproject.com/, or anywhere else you like! 
- For each visualization (good and bad):  
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) why you classified that visualization the way you did.

        ### [My Answer]

        #### Good Example

        ![Good Example](assignment_2_good_example.jpg)

        This comprehensive data visualization is for wealth management overview and client details. I think it's quite effective for presenting wealth management data. The followings are the reasons why I think itâ€™s a good data visualization.<br>
        - The visualizations are neatly organized, making it easy to navigate and understand different sections.<br>
        - The sidebar allows for quick filtering based on various attributes, enhancing interactivity.<br>
        - Colors are used effectively to differentiate categories and highlight important information.<br>
        - The gender distribution and client contribution pie charts use distinct colors for clear differentiation.<br>
        - The ability to sort by FUM in the client details table adds interactivity and enhances the usability of the data.<br>
        - Bar charts, pie charts, and tables are used appropriately for different types of data, aiding in quick comprehension.<br>

        #### Bad Example
        ![Bad Example](assignment_2_bad_example.jpg)

        This spiral chart from The New York Times is a data visualization depicting new Covid-19 cases in the United States over time. The followings are the reasons why I think itâ€™s a bad data visualization.<br>
        - The spiral design, while engaging, can be difficult to read and interpret, especially for viewers not familiar with this type of chart.<br>
        - It can be challenging to accurately compare values between different segments of the spiral due to the non-linear scale and the varying widths of the lines.<br>
        - The lack of clear axis labels and gridlines makes it difficult to determine exact values, which can be important for precise data interpretation.<br>
        - Key points such as the highest peaks or critical dates are not explicitly labeled, which could help viewers better understand the context.<br>
        - For an audience looking for quick, actionable insights, this chart may require more time to interpret than a straightforward line or bar chart.<br>
        - The visual complexity might overshadow the data's message, making it less accessible to a broad audience.<br>

    <br><br>
    - How could this data visualization have been improved? 
        ### [My Answer]
        For the good example, I found some tables and charts are quite dense. It may help to break down complex tables into smaller segments. Also, it could provide some brief explanations for certain metrics (like what "FUM" stands for or why certain products are top-ranked).

        For the bad example, while the spiral chart is innovative and visually appealing, it comes with readability and interpretability challenges. For conveying complex time-series data, especially to a broad audience, more traditional visualizations such as line or bar charts might be more effective.<br>
        - Accompany the spiral chart with more conventional charts (e.g., line charts) to provide alternative views of the same data, catering to different audience preferences.<br>
        - Add more prominent and frequent axis labels along the spiral to help viewers interpret the data more easily.<br>
        - Include gridlines or radial markers to assist in visualizing exact values at different points in the spiral.<br>
        - Use a minimalist color scheme to focus attention on the data. Avoid overly bright or clashing colors that might distract from the information.<br>
        - Introduce subtle visual aids, such as shading or background lines, to guide comparisons between different segments of the spiral representing different years.<br>

<br><br>
- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 500 words for each visualization (i.e. 
300 words for your good example and 500 for your bad example)
